2000	NOTAUTHED	The Authorisation was Declined by the bank.	"The Authorisation attempt was Declined by the cardholder's card-issuing bank. This could be due to several reasons such as funds not being available, spending limit may have been reached or bank account has been closed."	We also return to you the 2 digit Decline Code from the bank. To determine what the code means you will need to contact your merchant bank as they are bank specific.
2001	REJECTED	The Authorisation was Rejected by the vendor rule-base.	You will receive this error message when a transaction has been rejected due to either your AVS/CV2 rulebase or the customer has had three failed attempts to correctly enter their card details. The latter rulebase is set up as default on all Sage Pay accounts.	"The transaction would has failed due to the fraud rulebase which you have set up onto your account. The only way to prevent this from happening, would be to remove or relax your current rulebase, however this would apply to all your transactions."
2002	NOTAUTHED	The Authorisation timed out.	The authorisation process took longer than expected and therefore the Sage Pay system had timed out the transactions.  This could be caused by several reasons such as authorisation communication and high volumes of transactions being authorised.	
2003	ERROR	An ERROR has occurred on the Sage Pay System.	You will receive this error message for usually one or two reasons - if your Terminal ID's have not been set up correctly with your merchant bank or if we are experiencing intermittent authorisation issues where we have not been able to contact your merchant bank when requesting authorisation. This will be due to the transaction timing out and will result in transactions not being authorised and being registered as failed payments.	"If you receive this error message and are experiencing this on all your transactions, please contact our customer services team who will need to contact your merchant acquirer to ensure that everything has been set up correctly. If this error message has only appeared on one transaction, then please retry the transaction again.  If this does not resolve the issue, then please email the vendorTxCode along with your vendor name to our customer services team to investigate further."
2004	OK	The Release was Successful.	The deferred transaction has been successully released and will be sent for settlement.

2008	NOTAUTHED	The Transaction timed-out.	The authorisation response was taking longer than expected and has therefore timed-out as a security measure.

2009	NOTAUTHED	The network connection to the bank is currently unavailable.
