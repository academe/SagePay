2000	NOTAUTHED	The Authorisation was Declined by the bank.	"The Authorisation attempt was Declined by the cardholder's card-issuing bank. This could be due to several reasons such as funds not being available, spending limit may have been reached or bank account has been closed."	We also return to you the 2 digit Decline Code from the bank. To determine what the code means you will need to contact your merchant bank as they are bank specific.
2001	REJECTED	The Authorisation was Rejected by the vendor rule-base.	You will receive this error message when a transaction has been rejected due to either your AVS/CV2 rulebase or the customer has had three failed attempts to correctly enter their card details. The latter rulebase is set up as default on all Sage Pay accounts.	"The transaction would has failed due to the fraud rulebase which you have set up onto your account. The only way to prevent this from happening, would be to remove or relax your current rulebase, however this would apply to all your transactions."
2002	NOTAUTHED	The Authorisation timed out.	The authorisation process took longer than expected and therefore the Sage Pay system had timed out the transactions.  This could be caused by several reasons such as authorisation communication and high volumes of transactions being authorised.	
2003	ERROR	An ERROR has occurred on the Sage Pay System.	You will receive this error message for usually one or two reasons - if your Terminal ID's have not been set up correctly with your merchant bank or if we are experiencing intermittent authorisation issues where we have not been able to contact your merchant bank when requesting authorisation. This will be due to the transaction timing out and will result in transactions not being authorised and being registered as failed payments.	"If you receive this error message and are experiencing this on all your transactions, please contact our customer services team who will need to contact your merchant acquirer to ensure that everything has been set up correctly. If this error message has only appeared on one transaction, then please retry the transaction again.  If this does not resolve the issue, then please email the vendorTxCode along with your vendor name to our customer services team to investigate further."

3002	INVALID	The VPSTxId is invalid.	"This system message is generated when you have not supplied the correct value in the VPSTxId field. It is likely that you received this message when you were attempting to perform a related action to an original transaction (such as a REPEAT, RELEASE, VOID, REFUND etc.) as the VPSTxId, which uniquely identifies a transaction to the Sage Pay system, is generated by us and returned back to you."	"To correct this issue, you will need to check your code to ensure you are submitting the correct value. Also check to see if you have submitted the full VPSTxId, including the hyphens and curly brackets."
3003	INVALID	The Currency is invalid.	"Currency fields should contain 3-letter ISO 4217 codes e.g. GBP for UK Sterling, USD for U.S Dollars. If you submit a value which is not in line with the ISO 4217 codes or is not set up on your account, you will get this system message"	"Please check you code to ensure the Currency field of your POST contains a valid currency code, you may need to contact our customer services team to check which currencies are set up on your Sage Pay account."
3003b		"A valid ##### value is required, this should be either ##### or #####."		There is a problem with the details that have been supplied. Please check and retry.
3004	INVALID	The Amount is invalid	This system message is generated if the amount field contains any other characters than numerics or is not correctly formatted to the correct number of decimal places for the specified currency.	"You will need to make sure that you are sending the correct values for example: 123.45 4567.89 0.34 12.30 but not the values 123.456 4,567.89 .34 12.3 Check your code to ensure you are formatting the Amount field correctly"
3005	INVALID	The Amount is outside the mininum and maximum limits.	"The Sage Pay system has a maximum and minimum acceptable transaction value which are 100,000GBP and 0.01GBP respectively, with approximate equivalents in other currencies. Unfortunately, we are unable to process transaction values outside of these ranges.  You will receive this system message if you are passing an amount that is outside of the supported range."	You will need to ensure that the Amount field value which you are submitting is between 0.01 to 100000.00 or equivalent for other currencies
3006	INVALID	The fractional part of the Amount is invalid for the specified currency.	"If you have sent an Amount field with an invalid number of digits after the decimal place. e.g. 123.456 instead of 123.46, then you will receive this system message. You may also get this if you send fractional values to currencies that do not have minor units (like Japanese Yen, JPY, which only accepts whole number amounts)"	The Amount you are passing has more digits after than the decimal point than is allowed. Please look into the content of the field and ensure you only pass values to the allowed number of decimal places for that currency.
3006b		##### must be a numeric value.		There is a problem with the details that have been supplied. Please check and retry.
3007	INVALID	The RelatedSecurityKey format invalid.	"The RelatedSecurityKey is a unique security value for each transaction and would have been sent back to your server in the status response of the original transaction.

You will need to check that you are sending the correct SecurityKey of the original transaction in this field. This value is 10 alphanumeric characters long and should be retrieved from your database.
3007b		##### must be a numeric value with up to 2 decimal places.		There is a problem with the details that have been supplied. Please check and retry.
3008	INVALID	The Vendor or Vendorname format is invalid.	"The Vendor field should contain the Vendor Name which you specified on your application form when you signed up to Sage Pay. If you did not provide a vendor name, then it would have been supplied by Sage Pay. This is an important field as it allows us to identify and process the transaction through your account."	"All transactions which are posted to the Sage Pay system will contain a ""Vendor"" field which should contain your unique vendor name. You will need to check that this field is sending the correct reference. This will always be 16 characters or less, and only contain letters and numbers with no spaces or unusual characters."
3008b		##### supplied is too long.		There is a problem with the details that have been supplied. Please check and retry.
3009	MALFORMED	The VendorTxCode is missing.	A VendorTxCode has not been provided within your transaction registration. The VendorTxCode is a required field which is generated by you as a unique identifier for the transaction.	"You will need to check your code to ensure that you are sending this value or that the data is in the correct field. If you are using our Form integration method, you may also sometimes receive this message if your Encryption Password is incorrect, so we would suggest you check this information as well."

3010	INVALID	The RelatedVPSTxId is invalid.	"The VPSTxId uniquely identifies the original transaction which you are attempting to REFUND, REPEAT or AUTHORISE through the Sage Pay system. If you are attempting to perform these functions automatically (i.e you are performing any of the above outside of the My Sage Pay admin area) then you will need to submit the VPSTxId of the original transaction in a field called RelatedVPSTxId. If you have not supplied the correct value in the RelatedVPSTxId field, have not submitted it in full or it is incorrectly formatted then you will receive this system message when our systems try to validate the post."	You will need to check your code to ensure you are submitting the correct VPSTxId relating to the original transaction.

Your system should be storing this information and be retrieving it from your database when performing the above actions.
3011	INVALID	The NotificationURL format is invalid.
